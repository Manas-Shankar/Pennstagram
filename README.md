# Fakestagram

A clone of Instagram, built in React, Node with Express, AWS S3, and MongoDB. Features include the ability to create and edit posts, comment on and like posts, follow/unfollow different users by searching for them, infinite scrolling, and live polling. Tests were written in Jest and Supertest, with end-to-end testing done in Cypress. An S3 instance was used to store video/static image files, and MongoDB was used to store documents related to user, follower, and post data. The application was configured and deployed to Heroku.
